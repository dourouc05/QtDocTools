   <db:title>Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt</db:title>
   <db:para>Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide
                  certain features. Unlike the code described in the <db:link xlink:href="licenses.html">code used in Qt</db:link> document, these libraries are supplied alongside the
                  Qt modules.</db:para>
   <db:para>Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's
                  responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the LGPL
                  or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they
                  are using.</db:para>
   <db:para>Run <db:code>configure -help</db:code> to see any options that may be
                  available for controlling the use of these libraries.</db:para>
   <db:para>Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can normally be
                  found by reviewing the change history of the corresponding files in the public Qt
                  repository.</db:para>

                  2000-Jul-04 Copyright (C) 2000 by Catharon Productions, Inc. Introduction
                  ============ This license applies to source files distributed by Catharon
                  Productions, Inc. in several archive packages. This license applies to all files
                  found in such packages which do not fall under their own explicit license. This
                  license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group)
                  licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and
                  freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that: o We don't
                  promise that this software works. However, we are interested in any kind of bug
                  reports. (`as is' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you want,
                  in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) o You may
                  not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a
                  program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used
                  the Catharon Code. (`credits') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion
                  of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We
                  disclaim all warranties covering the packages distributed by Catharon Productions,
                  Inc. and assume no liability related to their use. Legal Terms =========== 0.
                  Definitions -------------- Throughout this license, the terms `Catharon Package',
                  `package', and `Catharon Code' refer to the set of files originally distributed by
                  Catharon Productions, Inc. `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the
                  project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
                  code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is
                  referred to as `a program using one of the Catharon Packages'. This license
                  applies to all files distributed in the original Catharon Package(s), including
                  all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file
                  in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you
                  are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must
                  contact us to verify this. The Catharon Packages are copyright (C) 2000 by
                  Catharon Productions, Inc. All rights reserved except as specified below. 1. No
                  Warranty -------------- THE CATHARON PACKAGES ARE PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT

                  WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY
                  THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE CATHARON PACKAGE. 2. Redistribution
                  ----------------- This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
                  irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy,
                  create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the Catharon Packages (in
                  both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose;
                  and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein,
                  subject to the following conditions: o Redistribution of source code must retain
                  this license file (`license.txt') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
                  to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The
                  copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies
                  of source files. o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
                  states that the software is based in part on the work of Catharon Productions,
                  Inc. in the distribution documentation. These conditions apply to any software
                  derived from or based on the Catharon Packages, not just the unmodified files. If
                  you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. 3.
                  Advertising -------------- Neither Catharon Productions, Inc. and contributors nor
                  you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
                  purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not
                  require, that you use the following phrase to refer to this software in your
                  documentation: 'this software is based in part on the Catharon Typography
                  Project'. As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.
                  However, as the Catharon Packages are copyrighted material, only this license, or
                  another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute,
                  and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the Catharon
                  Packages, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this
                  license. --- end of license.txt ---</db:programlisting>

      <db:para>
         <db:emphasis>IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements
                    Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility API gaps
                    in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a
                    usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the
                    Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility
                    interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA
                    while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document
                    applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web browsers
                    such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for rich text,
                    tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream
                    applications.</db:emphasis> -- quoted from <db:link xlink:href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2</db:link>.</db:para>

      <db:para>
         <db:emphasis>GBK is an extension of the GB2312 character set for simplified
                    Chinese characters, used in the People's Republic of China. GB is the
                    abbreviation of Guojia Biaozhun (国家标准), which means
                    national standard in Chinese, while K stands for Extension ("Kuozhan"). GBK not
                    only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but
                    also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of
                    GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly
                    unrepresentable, like the "rong" (镕) character in former Chinese Premier
                    Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable.</db:emphasis>

      <db:para>
         <db:emphasis>CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene. It is a high-performance, full-
                    featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene as it
                    is written in C++.</db:emphasis> -- quoted from
                    <db:code>qttools/src/assistant/3rdparty/clucene/README</db:code>.</db:para>
      <db:para>The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.
                  These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
                  License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute their
                  software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both* licenses, but
                  rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.</db:para>
      <db:para>To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed
                  under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License,
                  Version 2.0</db:para>
      <db:para>However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the
                  LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
                  of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both
                  for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the
                  GPL.</db:para>
      <db:para>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
                  question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
                  modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different ranges
                  of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, we
                  highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added
                  features.</db:para>
      <db:para>Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
                  package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for more
                  information.</db:para>
