                <html:p>Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide
                  certain features. Unlike the code described in the <html:a href="licenses.html"
                    >code used in Qt</html:a> document, these libraries are supplied alongside the
                  Qt modules.</html:p>
                <html:p>Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's
                  responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the LGPL
                  or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they
                  are using.</html:p>
                <html:p>Run <html:code>configure -help</html:code> to see any options that may be
                  available for controlling the use of these libraries.</html:p>
                <html:p>Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can normally be
                  found by reviewing the change history of the corresponding files in the public Qt

                <html:p><html:i>IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements
                    Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility API gaps
                    in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a
                    usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the
                    Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility
                    interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA
                    while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document
                    applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web browsers
                    such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for rich text,
                    tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream
                    applications.</html:i> -- quoted from <html:a

                <html:p><html:i>GBK is an extension of the GB2312 character set for simplified
                    Chinese characters, used in the People's Republic of China. GB is the
                    abbreviation of Guojia Biaozhun (&#22269;&#23478;&#26631;&#20934;), which means
                    national standard in Chinese, while K stands for Extension ("Kuozhan"). GBK not
                    only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but
                    also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of
                    GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly
                    unrepresentable, like the "rong" (&#38229;) character in former Chinese Premier
                    Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable.</html:i></html:p>

                <html:p><html:i>CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene. It is a high-performance, full-
                    featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene as it
                    is written in C++.</html:i> -- quoted from

                <html:p>The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.
                  These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
                  License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute their
                  software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both* licenses, but
                  rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.</html:p>
                <html:p>To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed
                  under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License,
                  Version 2.0</html:p>
                <html:p>However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the
                  LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
                  of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both
                  for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the
                  GPL.</html:p>
                <html:p>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
                  question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
                  modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different ranges
                  of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, we
                  highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added
                  features.</html:p>
                <html:p>Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
                  package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for more
                  information.</html:p>
