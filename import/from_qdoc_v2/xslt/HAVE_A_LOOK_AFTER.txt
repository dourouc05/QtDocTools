<db:para>The regular expression <db:code>/^\</db:code>}/ makes QDoc print until the first '}' character occurring at the beginning of the line without indentation. /.../ encloses the regular expression, and '^' means the beginning of the line. The '}' character must be escaped since it is a special character in regular expressions.</db:para>
